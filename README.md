#### _High-level story (elevator pitch):_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we’ve all been in the situation of tallying up our automotive expenses after each month and frowned and or sighed at the frightful overspending that happened on multiple occasions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your car is the life-line to your job, recreation and pleasure over great distances; it’s a very important tool that can easily make or break families. That’s where this site aims to help take some of the edge off, by helping you to budget the foreseen and the unforeseeable costly upkeep or even costly emergency repairs.
